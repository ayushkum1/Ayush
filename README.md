<p>I am a Computer Science Engineer, graduated in 2019. I was not fond of coding much, but after I developed my first app in Android, I started liking it.</p>
<p>I believe that for any given problem, there definitely exists a solution, we just need to find it! Troubleshooting problems keeps me engaged :D</p>
<p>Being deadline oriented and output oriented has helped me a lot in finishing my tasks before deadline with right output. Team Work has always been great, I easily mix with people.</p>
<p>Like to learn new things, be it from a kid or a expert.</p>
